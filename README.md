# discord-quest-completer

this script automatically completes all discord quests by spoofing game activity, streams, and video watching.

# BIG! DISCLAIMER 😨 this script violates https://discord.com/terms 😡 use at ur own risk 🥺

# usage
1. open discord on browser or app (streaming and playing quests require app)
2. open discord setting -> advanced -> turn on developer mode
3. accept all the quests you want to complete (you need to accept them all at the same time if you want to do multiple at once)
4. open devtools (ctrl + shit + i on windows or cmd + option + i on mac)
5. go to the console tab at the top of devtools
6. paste the script and press enter (it is recommended to not do any other actions on discord while the quests are in progress)

the script will automatically detect and complete all accepted and elligible quests

# Notes
- desktop app required for play and stream quests
- stream quests require:
  - streaming in a voice channel
  - at least 1 other person in the VC
- may break after Discord updates
- running many quests at once may cause rate limits
- close the console or exit discord to stop the script

the original script was from https://gist.github.com/aamiaa/204cd9d42013ded9faf646fae7f89fbb, but it was outdated hence why i decided to update it
